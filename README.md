# Software-Testing-analysis
Project where we deeply test and analyze a java project. We also refactored the old code
to get a more reliable, readable and correct java project.

Tools used:
ANTLR4  (used to create a parser that was able to read the logs)
QUICKCHECK (used to create the logs)
JUNIT (used to create unit tests to each method)
CLOVER (used to calculate code metrics)
PMD (used to detect badsmells on code)
RAPL (used to calculate time and energy of a program)
EVOSUITE (used to generate automatic unit tests for the project)
